File list:
	Run file
	Base station file
	Cache scheme

	Grouping(utility)

1. To run a program folder->run.m
2. In the run file:
	M-> cache size.
	N-> number of files in catalog.
	file_part or F->total number of paritions or bits respectively.
	num_cache_part-> number of partitions in cache per file.
	NumUsers -> number of users in the system.
	LAMBDA->arrival rate
	TotalRuns-> number of iterations for obtaining average.
3. plot plotAverageDelay to observe Average queueing delay of the system.
